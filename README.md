# COM3D2.ChoosyPreset
A plugin that allows you to selectively load parts of presets.

As it says on the tin. You simply open your preset panel and the menu will open with it. You'll notice there are two modes, simple and advanced. Simple is usually what you want. This plugin will likely be updated with the COM3D2.GUIAPI once I get around to finishing the plugin API so stay tuned for that update.

## Installation ##
1. Download the DLL from the release section
2. Place the DLL into BepinEx/plugins
3. Done.

Enjoy and don't abuse your meidos!
